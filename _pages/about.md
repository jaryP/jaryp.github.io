I took my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Sapienza, University of Rome, and Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in the same university. After obtaining the degree, I started the PhD in the <a href='https://sites.google.com/uniroma1.it/ispamm//'>ISPAMM Lab</a>, supervised by <a href='https://www.sscardapane.it/'>Simone Scardapane</a>. I obtained the PhD in 2023, researching mainly in the fields of Continual Learning and model Robustness.

Currently, I am a Post-Doc researcher in the same Lab, focussing mainly on Continual Learning, Robustness, and Semantic Communication.
